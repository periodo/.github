# PeriodO

PeriodO is a public domain gazetteer of scholarly definitions of historical, art-historical, and archaeological periods. It eases the task of linking among datasets that define periods differently. It also helps scholars and students see where period definitions overlap or diverge. To learn more, visit https://perio.do.

This GitHub organization is where we develop the software that runs PeriodO, including:

* The [PeriodO server](https://github.com/periodo/periodo-server)
* The [PeriodO web client](https://github.com/periodo/periodo-client)
* The [PeriodO command-line client](https://github.com/periodo/periodo-cli)
* [End-to-end tests](https://github.com/periodo/periodo-tests) for the PeriodO web client
* The [PeriodO placename gazetteers](https://github.com/periodo/periodo-places)

This is also where we keep PeriodO-related projects-in-development such as the [EDTF Ontology](https://github.com/periodo/edtf-ontology).
